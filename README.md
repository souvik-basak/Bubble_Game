# Bubble Pop Game ðŸ«§

Welcome to the Bubble Pop Game repository! This is a simple and entertaining web-based game where your goal is to pop as many bubbles as you can within a limited amount of time. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's a great way to challenge your reflexes and have some fun. The twist is that each bubble has a random number associated with it, and you can only score when the number matches the target number.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser or set up a local development server.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structuring the game layout.
- CSS3 for styling the user interface.
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.

### How to Play

- Launch the game by opening the `index.html` file.
- As soon as the game starts, bubbles will begin to appear on the screen.
- Click or tap on the bubbles to pop them.
- Also you have to match the number on the bubble to the target number to earn a score. 
- The game lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 60 seconds), so try to pop as many bubbles as you can before the timer runs out.

### Gameplay

- The gameplay is simple and enjoyable:
- When the game starts, bubbles will begin to appear on the screen, each containing a random number.
- A target number will be displayed at the top of the screen. Your goal is to pop bubbles in a way that their number matches the target number.
- Click on bubbles to pop them. The popped bubble number will be compared to the target number.
- If the number matches the target number, you'll earn points based on the number of bubbles popped.
- Keep popping bubbles and scoring points until the timer runs out.

### Scoring

Each bubble popped adds points to your score.
The faster you pop a bubble after it appears, the more points you'll earn.

### Game Over

The game ends when the timer reaches zero. 
At this point, you can see your final score and try to beat it in the next round!
